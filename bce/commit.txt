cmd/compile: make prove use poset to check non-negatives

Prove currently fails to remove bounds checks of the form:

if i >= 0 {              // hint that i is non-negative
    for i < len(data) {  // i becomes Phi in the loop SSA
        _ = data[i]      // data[Phi]; bounds check!!
	i++
    }
}

addIndVarRestrictions fails to identify that the loop induction 
variable, (Phi), is non-negative. As a result, the restrictions, 
i <= Phi < len(data), are only added for the signed domain. When 
testing the bounds check, addBranchRestrictions is similarly unable 
to infer that Phi is non-negative. As a result, the restriction, 
Phi >= len(data), is only added/tested for the unsigned domain.

This CL changes the isNonNegative method to utilise the factTable's 
partially ordered set (poset). It also adds field factTable.zero to
allow isNonNegative to query the poset using the zero(0) constant
found or created early in prove.

Fixes #28956
